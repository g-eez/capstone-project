asthma,"allergy, chest tightness, cold, cough, fever, shortness of breath, wheezing",Spirometry with bronchodilator: Measures reversible airway narrowing via spirometer before/after inhaler. Peak flow monitoring: Tracks airflow variability using a handheld peak flow meter. Allergy testing: Identifies triggers via skin prick or IgE blood tests.
bronchiectasis,"chest pain, cough, cough with blood, fatigue, fever, productive cough with yellow/green mucus, shortness of breath (worsens during flare-ups), wheezing",High-resolution CT: Gold standard for airway dilation detection. Sputum culture: Identifies pathogens using lab media. Pulmonary function tests: Measures lung capacity using spirometry equipment.
bronchiolitis,"cold, cough, fever, loss of appetite, nasal congestion, runny nose",Pulse oximetry: Monitors oxygen saturation using a fingertip oximeter. Chest X-ray: Used only for severe cases to visualize lung inflammation. Viral antigen test: Nasal swab analyzed by rapid antigen detection device.
bronchitis,"chest congestion, cough with yellow mucus, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, wheezing",Chest X-ray: Rules out pneumonia with X-ray imaging. Sputum analysis: Identifies bacterial vs viral cause under a microscope or PCR analyzer.
chronic bronchitis,"chest pain, mucus, shortness of breath, wheezing",Spirometry: Confirms airflow obstruction via forced exhalation into spirometer. Chest X-ray: Rules out other diseases using radiographic imaging. Sputum culture: Detects bacterial colonization via microbiology culture.
chronic cough,"cold, shortness of breath",Chest X-ray: Identifies underlying lung disease with imaging. Spirometry: Detects airflow obstruction via lung function test. ENT exam/Bronchoscopy: Visualizes airways using a fiberoptic scope.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"chronic cough, cold, fatigue, mucus, shortness of breath, wheezing",Spirometry: Measures airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC) using a spirometer; patient exhales forcefully into the tube. Chest X-ray/CT: Visualizes structural lung changes using radiography or CT scanner. Arterial blood gases: Evaluates oxygen/CO₂ via blood sample analyzer.
influenza,"chills, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, high fever, joint pain, muscle aches, nasal congestion, nausea, runny nose, sore throat, vomiting",Rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT): Detects viral antigens from nasal swab. PCR test: Confirms strain using thermal cycler. Chest X-ray: Assesses pneumonia complications with imaging plate.
mesothelioma,"chest pain, dry cough, lower back pain, shortness of breath",Chest CT scan: Detects pleural thickening using cross-sectional imaging. Pleural biopsy: Extracts tissue using a biopsy needle for microscopic examination. Thoracoscopy: Directly visualizes pleura with a thoracoscope camera.
pneumonia,"chest pain, cold, cough with blood, cough with green mucus, cough with yellow mucus, fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, rapid breathing, shaking, shallow breathing, shortness of breath, sweating, vomiting","Chest X-ray: Confirms lung infiltrates using radiographic imaging equipment placed against the chest. Sputum culture/Gram stain: Identifies bacterial cause using a microscope and staining reagents. Blood tests (CBC, CRP): Detect inflammation via lab analyzers. Pulse oximetry: Measures oxygen saturation using a fingertip oximeter."
pneumothorax,"cold, cyanosis, dry cough, fatigue, fever, rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat, sharp chest pain, shortness of breath",Chest X-ray/CT: Confirms collapsed lung with imaging. Arterial blood gas test: Measures oxygen/CO₂ using arterial blood drawn with a syringe.
pulmonary hypertension,"chest pain, dizziness, edema, fainting, fatigue, heart palpitations, shortness of breath",Echocardiogram: Estimates arterial pressure using ultrasound probe on chest. Right heart catheterization: Measures pressure directly via catheter insertion. CT pulmonary angiography: Visualizes pulmonary arteries using contrast dye and CT scanner.
respiratory syncytial virus,"cold, rapid shallow breathing, wheezing cough",Rapid antigen/PCR test: Confirms RSV from nasal swab using lab analyzer. Chest X-ray: Used only for severe lower airway involvement.
sleep apnea,"daytime sleepiness, dry mouth, frequent waking, irritability, memory/concentration problems, mood changes, morning headaches, sleep apnea episodes, snoring","Polysomnography: Monitors breathing, heart rate, and oxygen overnight using sensors and EEG leads. Oximetry: Records overnight oxygen fluctuations using pulse oximeter."
tuberculosis,"chills, fever, loss of appetite, night sweats, persistent cough, weight loss",Sputum microscopy/culture: Detects acid-fast bacilli using Ziehl–Neelsen stain and incubator. GeneXpert/PCR: Confirms TB DNA and resistance with automated molecular analyzer. Chest X-ray: Shows characteristic lesions with X-ray imaging.
