    "The aim of this project is to build a system that simplifies medical information retrieval for respiratory illnesses. Instead of relying on traditional machine learning models for prediction, the approach focuses on **data preprocessing and retrieval-based matching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Map **symptoms ‚Üí disease ‚Üí treatment** in a structured way.\n",
    "* Convert the dataset into a clean, consistent CSV where each row represents a **unique disease‚Äìtreatment pair with its associated symptoms**.\n",
    "* Feed this structured data into a **vector database** (e.g., FAISS or Chroma) for efficient semantic search.\n",
    "* Allow user queries (e.g., \"shortness of breath and coughing\") to be matched against the database, retrieving the most relevant disease and its treatment options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traditional predictive modeling is unnecessary here. Instead, the objective is **precise matching and retrieval** of knowledge.\n",
    "* This method ensures **transparency and explainability**‚Äîusers see exactly which symptoms map to which disease and treatment.\n",
    "* It also supports cases where a disease has multiple treatments (each treatment is preserved as a separate entry).\n",
    "\n",
    "This business framing highlights the project‚Äôs role as a **student-friendly, cost-free RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline prototype** that prioritizes **usability, clarity, and reproducibility** over model complexity.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Symptoms**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We successfully reduced the noisy raw 78 unique symptoms down to **66 standardized symptoms**.\n",
    "   * Variations such as spelling errors, synonyms, and near-duplicates were consolidated (e.g., *‚Äúcoughing up blood‚Äù* and *‚Äúcough with blood‚Äù* now map to the same label).\n",
    "   * Informative variations were **preserved** (e.g., *‚Äúdry cough‚Äù* vs *‚Äúchronic cough‚Äù* vs *‚Äúproductive cough with yellow/green mucus‚Äù*).\n",
    "   * Remaining `nan` entries represent missing or unrecorded symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Treatments**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Treatment options were consolidated into **27 unique values**.\n",
    "   * Inconsistencies such as *‚Äúantibiotic‚Äù*, *‚Äúantibiotics.‚Äù*, etc., were standardized into a single category **‚Äúantibiotics‚Äù**.\n",
    "   * Duplicates like *‚Äúconsult doctor‚Äù* vs *‚Äúconsult a doctor‚Äù* were unified.\n",
    "   * Some still remain descriptive (e.g., *‚Äústay away from cold places‚Äù*) but that‚Äôs fine, as these represent actual treatment variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Readiness for Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The dataset is now **clean enough to begin restructuring** into the **RAG-friendly format** (disease ‚Üí all associated symptoms + treatment options).\n",
    "   * Next, we‚Äôll handle **missing values** (mainly in `Age`, `Nature`, and the `nan` in `symptom_standardized` and `Treatment`)  "
